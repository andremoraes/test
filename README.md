# Chess
My wonderful java chess game

A chess project created in java.

To run this project, you can create a new java project in eclipse, copy files in the root folder into the project folder and others into the src folder.
Simply run the Main to start the game.

To make a move in the game, you can either click in the panel or type a command in the standard chess recording format in the console.
This smart program is able to show you all those legal moves you can make and determine whether the game has end.
Some complex rules of chess like En passant and castling are also checked and suggested.

If you find a game interesting, you can also get the full records of the game by typing 'print' and a standard formated chess records would be printed in the console.
To restart a game, you can type 'restart' in the console.

If you have any questions or suggestion, you can contact me at fredzqm@gmail.com
